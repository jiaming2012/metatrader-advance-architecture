I took my first college computer science course, Introduction to Java, during the summer of 2009. At the time, I was in between switching majors and wanted to explore different course options. My professor, a brilliant polymath who decided to pursue a career in higher education after finishing successful a career as a concert pianist, stood atop a desk in the front of class rambling on about the merits of data-structures. His thick British accent rang through the lecture hall as he finished a metaphor about a __*queue*__ being some sort of cha-cha line, all while my classmates, shoulder to shoulder, roared with laughter as a girl in the front of the ran back to her desk while a new student ran to the front, attaching himself to the end of the line. I distinctly recall a feeling of both excitement and unease, as although touched by my professor's fervor, I knew that I still did not fundamentally grasp the difference between a queue and a linked-list or how either could be used to help me pass our quiz next week.

At the end of the summer, I quickly arrived to the conclusion that computer science was not for me and ultimately went on to study Math and Economics. Finance was much more appealing to me. So after graduation, I secured a job at a boutique foreign exchange firm. Our company, originally a pure technology provider, decided to dabble in the area of finance and using years of data acquired from it's technology platform, opened a market risk desk. I instantly wanted a role in the new department; however, to my dismay, the prerequisites that our hiring manager was seeking were a strong knowledge of algorithms, data structures, and programming ... if only I had liked cha-cha more :(

It took a little more than a year of staying late after work and a few generous souls from our dev team that answered my many-many daily questions, but finally, I was eventually able to weasel my way into our market risk department as a junior python developer. Unbeknown to me, my love for computer science and fin-tech was beginning to foster.
